      The open philosophy of wiki – allowing anyone to edit content – does not
      ensure that every editor's intentions are well-mannered. For example,
      vandalism (changing wiki content to something offensive, adding nonsense,
      maliciously removing content, or deliberately adding incorrect
      information, such as hoax information) can be a major problem. On larger
      wiki sites, such as those run by the Wikimedia Foundation, vandalism can
      go unnoticed for some period of time. Wikis, because of their open nature,
      are susceptible to intentional disruption, known as "trolling". Wikis tend
      to take a soft-security approach to the problem of vandalism, making
      damage easy to undo rather than attempting to prevent damage. Larger wikis
      often employ sophisticated methods, such as bots that automatically
      identify and revert vandalism and JavaScript enhancements that show
      characters that have been added in each edit. In this way, vandalism can
      be limited to just "minor vandalism" or "sneaky vandalism", where the
      characters added/eliminated are so few that bots do not identify them and
      users do not pay much attention to them.[29][unreliable source] An example
      of a bot that reverts vandalism on Wikipedia is ClueBot NG. ClueBot NG can
      revert edits, often within minutes, if not seconds. The bot uses machine
      learning in lieu of heuristics.[30]
      <br /><br />
      Malware can also be a problem for wikis, as users can add links to sites
      hosting malicious code. For example, a German Wikipedia article about the
      Blaster Worm was edited to include a hyperlink to a malicious website.
      Users of vulnerable Microsoft Windows systems who followed the link would
      be infected.[10] A countermeasure is the use of software that prevents
      users from saving an edit that contains a link to a site listed on a
      blacklist of malicious sites.
