        Hello As mentioned, gradients are coming back, and we’re seeing them
        more and more — including in branding, illustration, typography and UI.
        Gradients make more colors available because they create more color
        tones. Gradients are eye-catching and memorable because they’re colorful
        and playful and make for visuals we’re not used to seeing. We don’t even
        have the right words to define color gradients yet. And in step with the
        trends for 2018, we can use gradients to create awesome digital and
        graphic designs.
